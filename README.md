# Visualize-This
An audio visualizing chrome extension that works with pages using HTML5 Audio.

No longer in development as changes to Chrome and/or the webpages this was written for broke compatability. I am now focusing on contributing to https://github.com/SuperUser320/muse

Originall ran on:
-Google Play Musics' listen page via a 'Visualize' button next to settings: https://play.google.com/music/listen
-YouTube videos via a button with three bars next to the settings button: https://www.youtube.com
